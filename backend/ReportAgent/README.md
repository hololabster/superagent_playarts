# Agent-Based Web3 Service Integration Project

This project offers an all-in-one solution that unifies:

- **One-Shot (LoRA) Training**: Build a personalized agent with only one (or a few) images.
- **Web3 Wallet/NFT Analysis**: Analyze wallets and NFT data.
- **Twitter Auto-Posting**: Generate context-aware images and automatically post them on Twitter.
- **Revenue Sharing & Agent Monetization**: Turn your trained agents into valuable assets.

## Key Features

### One-Shot LoRA Training
- Train a LoRA model with just a single or few images.
- `TrainerService` handles background removal (SAM), compositing, auto-caption, and training.
- Once training completes, the agent is registered in the DB with a unique `agent_key`.

### Web3 Wallet / NFT Analysis
- `NFTService` and `WalletService` to parse wallet addresses, NFT data, and transactions.
- Summarize findings via LLM-based reporting.

### Agent API (Monetization & Revenue Split)
- After training, the agent is ready for image generation via `/agent/<agent_key>/inference`.
- The agent owner can share or sell usage rights, enabling potential revenue streams.

### Twitter Integration
- Create an AI-driven tweet: LLM to interpret user messages or NFT/wallet context → agent-generated image → auto-upload to Twitter.

### Revenue Sharing Model
- Deploy agent as an NFT, or integrate a smart contract to handle royalty splits.
- Earn from API usage fees or secondary sales.

git clone https://github.com/yourrepo/agent-web3-project.git
cd agent-web3-project
```

### Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Setup (Django Example)

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Set Environment Variables (.env)

- DB credentials, RPC_URL, LLM Token, Twitter Keys, etc.

### Run Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Example Workflows

### Train Agent via One-Shot

1. **Upload training image:**
   ```http
   POST /api/upload_training_image/
   {
       "character_name": "example_name",
       "image": (file upload)
   }
   ```
   - Returns `task_id`

2. **Check training status:**
   ```http
   GET /api/check_training_status/?task_id=xxx
   ```
   - Poll until `status=completed`
   - A new `AgentModel` record with a unique `agent_key` is created

### Wallet Analysis

```http
POST /api/send_message/
{
    "message": "0x1234..."
}
```
- The system recognizes the wallet address → calls `wallet_service.analyze_wallet()` → LLM to generate a summary.

### Auto Tweet

```http
POST /twit
{
    "agentKey": "uuid",
    "targetMessage": "some scenario"
}
```
- LLM interprets, the agent generates an image, and the image is posted via Tweepy.

### Agent Monetization

```http
GET /agent/<agent_key>/inference
```
- Generate images using that LoRA-based agent.
- The agent owner can share API keys, charge fees, or implement profit-sharing.

### Integration test:
1. Upload an image to train an agent.
2. Verify `agent_key` is issued in DB.
3. Generate images via `/agent/<agent_key>/inference`.
4. Confirm Twitter auto-posting if configured.

## Additional Notes
- **Revenue Sharing**: Not fully implemented in this code but can be integrated with a separate contract or DB logic.
- **Scalability**: Docker containers, multi-GPU setups, or cloud orchestration.
- **Security**: Restrict agent usage with JWT or IP-based authentication.
- **Secondary Creations**: Turn a trained agent into an NFT with references to LoRA weights, enabling resale or licensing.

## Chatbot System: Real User Interaction Flow

### 1. Creating Your Personal Agent (Chat Interface)
- Open chat and send an image of your character, or directly import from your existing NFT.
- Chatbot confirms receipt and begins training your AI agent with one-shot training.
- Receive a chat notification once training is complete.

### 2. Wallet and NFT Analysis (Chat Interface)
- Type your wallet address directly into the chat.
- The chatbot analyzes your wallet activities and NFTs.
- It responds with a clear, conversational summary and insights.

### 3. Generating Images & Tweeting via Chat
- Describe the type of image or outfit you want directly in chat.
- The chatbot uses Anime Segmentation and Inpainting with a Magic Brush to remix and style your NFT while keeping the original style intact.
- Confirm if you want the chatbot to automatically post the image to Twitter.

### 4. Monetizing Your Agent (Chat Interaction)
- Chatbot provides an easy-to-use link to monetize your trained agent.
- Set pricing or usage rights directly via conversational prompts.
- Receive automated royalty updates within the chat interface.

### 5. Continuous Engagement
- Chat with your agent regularly; the chatbot learns and improves from each interaction.
- Get suggestions and real-time feedback through friendly chat conversations.

### Example Chat Flow:
1. You: "Import this NFT and train an AI agent from it."
2. Bot: "Got it! Training your personal AI agent now. I'll notify you shortly."
3. Bot: "Your agent is ready! What would you like to create?"
4. You: "Remix my NFT with a futuristic outfit using the Magic Brush."
5. Bot: "Done! Should I tweet this for you?"

This simplified chat-based approach makes using advanced AI features, NFTs, and monetization straightforward and enjoyable for all users.
